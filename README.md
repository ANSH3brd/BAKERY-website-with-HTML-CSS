**SWEET TREAT BAKERY**

Description
Sweet Treat Bakery is a modern, website created to provide an engaging and interactive experience for users who wish to explore a variety of delectable bakery products. The website highlights an extensive range of baked goods, including cakes, cookies, pastries, and beverages, all organized into visually appealing sections. Each product category is designed to captivate users with high-quality images, inviting text, and a seamless layout.

The purpose of this website is not only to showcase bakery items but also to offer a user-friendly interface to customers. The website utilizes HTML for structuring content, CSS for styling and enhancing the user experience, and integrates Font Awesome icons for additional visual appeal, especially in the footer where customers can find the bakery's social media and contact links.

Interactive elements such as hover effects on images and buttons enhance the user interaction and make the browsing experience more engaging. In addition, the website features a customer reviews section, where past customers can share their feedback about the bakery’s products, adding a layer of authenticity and trust for new visitors.

The contact section in the footer is designed to offer visitors easy access to the bakery’s social media channels, allowing them to follow updates, offers, and seasonal products. The use of customized scrollbars and carefully crafted hover effects gives the site a polished and professional appearance, making the Sweet Treat Bakery stand out from typical bakery websites.

This project showcases a combination of web development skills, including HTML for the site structure, CSS for the visual styling and responsiveness, and effective use of design principles to create a professional, user-centric website. It serves as a practical example of how modern web technologies can be employed to create a smooth and aesthetically pleasing user experience in the food and beverage industry.
